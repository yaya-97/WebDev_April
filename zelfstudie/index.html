<h1>This is the first header</h1>
<h2>This is the second header</h2>
<h3>This is the third header</h3>
<h4>This is the fourth header</h4>
<h5>This is the fifth header</h5>
<h6>This is the sixth header, I don't think it can get smaller than that in terms of headers, but I'll use the h7 tag on the next sentence...</h6>

<h7>Hmmm...It seems like that just makes it look like a paragraph. Oh well...</h7>

<p>This is a paragraph. There's no numbering or hierarchy, just use the letter p as a tag.</p>
<p>This is just another paragraph.</p>
<p>And another one. Enough with the text, let's put an image in this mess.</p>

<img src="./cocktail.png">
<!-- When choosing the directory location of the image you want to add, use the following syntax: " ./ "   " -->

<br>

<!-- When wanting to get back to a new line while typing, choose the right line, and add the following syntax: <br> -->

Does this work? Huh, apparantly when using no tag whatsoever for text, it just behaves like a paragraph. Good to know.

<p>Let's create links, how about linking this next line to a famous search engine?</p>

<p>Let's go!</p>

<p>How about we do this with an image?</p>
